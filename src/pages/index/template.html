      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This website lets you generate CSS code to set a property's value based
        on the viewport width. It essentially helps you do what's described in
        <a
          href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/"
          >Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp</a
        >,

        and

        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Can't I just use the <code>vw</code> unit?</h2>
      <p>
        You must, but doing it manually is extra work. If you wanted to have a
        12px font size on a 280px screen, a 16px font size on a 768px screen,
        and all sizes inbetween, you'd have to manually create a linear function
        that goes through both points. This website can do that for you.
      </p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        Here is an example of the font size being determined by two breakpoints.
        The stripes denote the area between the breakpoints, where the
        interpolation happens.

          >
          was used to simulate the viewport.</small
        >
      </p>

      <h2>More than 2 points</h2>
      <p>
        Although it may be simple to manually make a function such as the one
        specified above, you may sometimes require more than two points. We call
        such point a breakpoint (a viewport size and an associated size), and
        this website lets you specify way more than two of them. Take the
        following table as an example.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Viewport size</th>
            <th>Font size</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>280px</td>
            <td>12px</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>320px</td>
            <td>10px</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>480px</td>
            <td>24px</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>640px</td>
            <td>28px</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>768px</td>
            <td>16px</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Given the above breakpoints, this website generates the following code
        which goes through all of them.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-css">font-size: min(12px, 26px + -5vw);
@media screen and (min-width: 320px) {
  font-size: calc(-18px + 8.75vw);
}
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  font-size: calc(12px + 2.5vw);
}
@media screen and (min-width: 640px) {
  font-size: max(16px, 88px + -9.38vw);
}</code></pre>
